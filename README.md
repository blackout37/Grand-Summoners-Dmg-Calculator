# Grand-Summoners-Dmg-Calculator
simple alpha-stage damage calculator for the phone app game called Grand Summoners. written in visual studio. anyone interested in knowing more feel free to comment.(known issue: crit/elemental dmg/break not properly multiplicative. fixing soon)
All values are not entered as % based.
You will notice some values have a 1, these need to be a number aside from 0 for output to occure properly.
Break and Crit have been moved to check boxes since these values are always constant, ie: 1 or 1.25.
Any and all suggestions please make sure to include enough information to make a change.
Gl and enjoy.
